# GeoTortoise

GeoTortoise is a simple library that provides geospatial capabilities to tortoise-orm.
The current code is an adaptation of the previous work done on the [tortoise-gis](https://github.com/revensky/tortoise-gis) and an old tortoise-orm [fork](https://github.com/arlyon/tortoise-orm).

TODO:

- Mock database so we don't need a real PostGIS connection for testing
- Add more tests
